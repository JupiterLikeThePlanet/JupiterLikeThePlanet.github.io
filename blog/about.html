<!--<h1>About Me</h1>-->
<p> I'm glad you could make it to this page.  Wondering a bit about me?  Let me lift the skirt just an inch to make things interesting then.  I currently live in Los Angeles, but before that I was from this little town called New Orleans.  Ever heard of it? There's a quote about the people from there: "We talk too much and laugh too loud and live too large and, frankly we're suspicious of those who don't."  That about encapsulates the firecracker running this page. But don't worry, I'm of the friendly ilk.</p>

<p>Perhaps, you'd like to know that which piques my interest?  Other than some good banter and badinage, I quite enjoy the topics of language and linguistics.  I spent my college years picking up a few foreign tongues and trying them out around the world.  As for music, my preferences are eclectic, but I'll always have a soft spot for the acquired taste of Dixieland and Hot Jazz. In my free time, I enjoy the art of standing up and sketch comedy, because if you don't laugh, you cry.  I also find the most comfortable thing I can do with my body is place my tongue firmly in cheek.
</p>

<p>Still reading this? Boy, you sure are a noisy one, ain't ya? Ok, well, allow me to limn a more serious side.  Everyone seeks a purpose, some creed or another to live by.  I have chosen my mantra: "Science, expression, and the pursuit of understanding."  Life to me means being a perpetual student, humbling ourselves to all the knowledge that's out there to be had.  Expressing ourselves in the form of art is to engage the world of reason that surrounds us with a sensory experience of emotion.</p>

<p> All that aside, matter & energy are neither created nor destroyed. You, me, and everyone we know have always been and always will be. We were randomly born into the form we know now, "the ego", and it has been quite an enjoyable experience so far and I feel lucky to have shared this blip of a moment in the expanse of time with you.</p>
<p>
Enjoy the site.
