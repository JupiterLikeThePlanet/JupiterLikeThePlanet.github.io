      It's been an interesting couple of weeks learning about DBC and soaking up the information about their culture.   It is apparent that they are seeking to merge Eastern style principles into our well established Western lifestyle that many of us have.  Personally, I am drawn to this idea and I like that DBC is seeking to help us develop a mindset about achieving ideals, specifically for ourselves.  To be more specific, I've longed for a place where we can expose our vulnerabilities, particularly being able to say "I don't know," without judgement.  I've long held to the mindset that we fail more than we succeed and it's difficult to develop when we can't admit our own weaknesses.  It's difficult to implement this lifestyle in a society that operates on a contrary system and, unfortunately, it draws us to play by their rules.  This can ultimately stunt our personal growth.

    The more I learn about DBC, I am hopeful that this is a place where I can achieve a greater ideal of myself.  What I imagine I could compare it to, is that I hope it's like an accepting improv environment in which we understand that we will be putting ourselves out there and that it won't always be pretty, but we're trying.  The minimizing of a competitive culture means that the focus is on the productivity of the group, a co-op that seeks to make everybody better instead of getting ahead of others.  These are the principles I am excited about and I see myself as engaging this environment with an honesty and humility of ignorance in which I will be able to actualize the learner and programmer I want to be.
