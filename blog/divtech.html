  <h3> Defining what's disparate </h3>
  <p> One of my favorite sites, known for breaking down information graphically, is<a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/"> Information Is Beautiful</a>. Here's a great example of their work on Diversity in tech:</p>
  <br>
  <p align=center>
    <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/"><img src="../imgs/Diversity-In-Tech_2015.png" height="1300" width="1000" alt="Diversity in Tech"/></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Quoting the site, here is the how and what of their measure: "Which tech companies employ the most people of colour and which are more of a whitewash? We sifted through global employee data from 18 tech firms, ranked them by race and gender, then compared against the general US population."  Extrapolating from this data, white people, for all intents and purposes, are represented proportionally to the population.  If I had to be specific, they are represented just shy of their actual numbers.  Asians are extensively represented.  For example, in the realm of social media sites, at the lowest they are represented seven times more than is proportional to their population size in this country.
  </p>
  <p>
    So when we talk about disparities in diversity it's usually about women, latinos, and blacks.  Each of those groups are underrepresented by a significant margin.

  <h3> Examples of disparity </h3>
  <p> Here are some quotes on disparities going on within the tech field:
  <ul>
    <li><span> "Only about 11% of U.S. firms with venture-capital backing in 2009 had current or former female CEOs or female founders, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource." Shira Ovide,<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2010/08/27/addressing-the-lack-of-women-leading-tech-start-ups/">'Addressing The Lack Of Women Leading Tech Start-Ups'</a>, Wall Street Journal</span></li>

   <br> <li><span>
    "...new research that shows Hispanics earn $16,353 a year less on average than their colleagues who are not Hispanic.  In the same high-skilled positions such as computer programmers and software developers, Asians make $8,146 less than whites and blacks $3,656 less than whites, according to the report from the American Institute for Economic Research." - Jessica Guynn,<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/09/high-tech-pay-gap-hispanics-asians-african-americans/16606121/"> USA TODAY</a></span></li>

  <h3> What helps? </h3>
  <p>  These answers are somewhat idealist, but I wanted to address aspects that affect us at a more personal level, since that's more or less all we can be more certain to change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keeping an open mind and awareness.  This concerns the idea of 'metacognition', or self awareness.  We, as human beings (ALL OF US), are capable of unconcious bias.    One must open to evaluating themselves and their actions  We should keep our ears open to outside ideas and actively search for problem areas of our field.  When presented with a disparity, like pay gaps for minorities, amelliorate the situation by dispersing equal pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cultural Issue:  I'll use the gender gap to illustrate this point. It is often cited that girls are discouraged (or not encouraged) from pursuing interests in math and science because it doesn't play into the ideas of what it means to be a women.  Essentially, women are being told they should be one thing over another because that's what society expects of them.  I get it. I'm a scrawny, nerdy beta male who despises sports and mainstream ideas of manliness.  We're all told sold some narrative as a society, but as we become more informed, those narratives should come under challenge and be more open to fluid roles between gender, race, or whatever 'thing' people will have you defined as.  More importantly, those who are self aware and informed should vocal about these issues and behave accordingly.  You know, lead by example.  </p>
  <p>
    But more importantly on a larger scope, there should be a bigger emphasis on STEM careers.
