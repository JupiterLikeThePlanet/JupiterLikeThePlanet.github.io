      # What are the benefits of version control?

      If I had to give the elevator pitch, Version Control is a useful tool to tell us who, when, and why someone made changes to a file.  Now, allow me to enumerate on the benefits this brings:

        (1) The use of commits, or save points, allows users to go back to earlier versions of a program in case of an error or bug
        (2) As a collaborative effort, multiple users can freely work on the project at the same time without interfering with the main code.
        (3) Lends an understanding between different versions, provides a list of all changes, and lists descriptions of why a developer makes a change.
        (4) It serves as an effective organization of changes

      #How does git help you keep track of changes?

      Git uses commits as save points.  Each commit that is created takes a snapshot of a program at a particular time.  You can see these if you type git log into the CLI.  If you commit often, you will see a program as it progresses along a time line.  Here's a breakdown of how to create and track changes:
              (1) Open terminal and go to the appropriate git path where you will be making changes.
              (2) When you enter git, be sure to enter git status and git pull to make sure your master branch is up to date
              (3) create a new branch by entering git checkout -b [branch_name]
              (4) Do work / make changes
              (5) To track your work, type git add [file]
              (6) Then make a save point by entering git commit -m "[Title of change]"
      And that's how you track changes on git (Warning! This is not refering to GitHub, just git)

      # Why use GitHub to store your code?
      Github gives developers a place to store programs and creates a platform for a massive collaborative effort.  When your program is open to the public, developers from the web can work on and contribute changes to your code, helping you build better software.  Likewise, this provides developers an opportunity to work on other people's programs and practice their skill.
