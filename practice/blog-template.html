#How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was an interesting affair.  It can be tedious while creating a wireframe in front of somebody, which I apologize for being more meticulous than was probably necessary.  However, it's good to get feedback and exchange ideas of how something should look or what, perhaps, has better aesthetic. It's good to get an opinion other than own's own, whether to confirm our insanity is brilliance or that our percieved brilliance is insanity.  As for the code, it was fairly easy to pair with someone.  This is more the craft portion, so it was more about tinkering with what functions and how to place things, rather than determining what looks pleasing.

#Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yeah!  Why wouldn't it?  You've got to have a rough copy before you turn over a final draft.  That's just good practice.  I mean, currently without css development skills, it's harder to make an idea come to full fruition, but you can get a basic idea of the landscape if labelled properly in the html.

#What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Simplicity and minimalism.

#What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

We went over <section> and scrollbar codes.  Though we didn't get the scrollbar codes (<aside>) to work, we looked over how to do it and got a general idea.
