##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

To be fair, I only played with the margins.  I found that using em's were effective in moving things the way I wanted to.  Also, splitting things into divs made it more effective to play with margins and move elements around the way I wanted.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I understand relative position better because in understanding the default position, I know where I'm moving things around.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Basic elements like font size, weight, color, and so on are quite easy to code and get what you want.  Spacing with margins, inlining, and positioning all take some time to figure. Admittedly, I'm still working on the exact science of it.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I had a lot of rookie mistakes in my coding, particularly in the literal syntax.  I spent over 3 hours trying to link my stylesheet only to find out the problem was that I had forgotten to add an 's' to my directory name in href.  Maddening.  What did I learn? CHECK SPELLING.
